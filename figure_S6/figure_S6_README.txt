Segregation of KASP markers data for all BC1-S2 populations is included in Excel “figure_S6_full_population.xlsx”.
One sheet for every population. Plants highlighted were considered informative recombinants between M12 and M32.
 
KASP data for informative recombinants are included in Excel file “figure_S6_recombinants.xlsx”. One sheet for every population.

NOTE. In order to generate the figure, marker data of BC1S2 recombinants were compressed to show only haplotypes (multiple plants with same marker genotype).
      Further, genotype of BC1S1 parental plants that were selfed to generate each population was also included.
